  <h1>of the Collins and Landgren Families</h1>
  <h3>The history begins with the birth of Sylvia Landgren Haney, the daughter of Roberta Collins and Erick Landgren, and my grandmother. Start the journey back in time with her much beloved grandmother <a href="{{ '/landgren/person/emma-sandqvist/' | relative_url }}">Emma Olsson Sandqvist Landgren</a> who came over from SÃ¶dra Sallerup parish in Sweden or jump back to her eighth great grandfather, the first president of Rhode Island, <a href="{{ '/collins/person/president-john-coggeshall' | relative_url }}">John Coggeshall</a>. Or dive right into family trees of the <a href="{{ '/collins/about/' | relative_url }}">Collins Family</a>, or the <a href="{{ '/landgren/about/' | relative_url }}">Landgren Family</a>.</h3>
