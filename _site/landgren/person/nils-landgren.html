  <div class="person-content" itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>On October 28th, 1901, Nils Landgren left his home and mother to live in Umeå Stad, in the county of Västerbotten <sup>(<a href="#2A">2A</a>)</sup>. His mother, Johanna Ljungberg, died less than a year later on the 13th of June, 1902 <sup>(<a href="#2A">2A</a>)</sup>. He was not yet conscripted into the army as the age of conscription at this time was 21, and he is only 21 when he left Torupshus. There is no record in the “Värnpligtsförhållanden” column or conscription record column <sup>(<a href="#2A">2A</a>)</sup>.</p>

<p>In Umeå Stad, he is recorded as having arrived with three other men (Otto Sigfried Larsson, August Jonsson, and Otto Herman Jonsson) from Malmöhus County on the same day, the 6th of Novemeber, 1901. All three of them are labeled as “Rekryt” or a recruit. They do not yet have enrollment numbers <sup>(<a href="#2B">2B</a>)</sup>.</p>

<p>He lived in Umeå Stad until November 1904, when he moved to Tullstorp #7, in the parish of Södra Sallerup of Malmöhus County <sup>(<a href="#2C">2C</a>)</sup>. His sister and her husband’s family were living there as well and their family is recorded just above Nils’ entry. He now has a number in the värnpligtsförhållanden columun: “364 69/1904.” His number in the enrollment area “69” is 364, and he was conscripted in the year 1904. The enrollment area number 69 corresponded to Umeå in the period of 1902-1918 in the county of Västerbottens <sup>(<a href="#11">11</a>)</sup>. This matches where he was living from 1901 to 1904. During the years of 1902-1907, draftees underwent 172 days of training with 112 days of basic training and three 30 day refresher courses <sup>(<a href="#11">11</a>)</sup>. Further information on the particular regiment he served in is unavailable at this time, most likely found through his draft card. This is located behind a paywall at Arkiv Digital, as well as in Sweden at their national archives <sup>(<a href="#11">11</a>)</sup>.</p>

<p>Both he and his sister’s family moved to Burlöv parish on the 14th of April, 1905 <sup>(<a href="#2C">2C</a>)</sup> and arrived in Sunnanå #7 farm/village in Burlöv parish on the 26th of that month <sup>(<a href="#2D">2D</a>)</sup>. From here he separated from the family in April 1907 and moved back to Södra Sallerup parish while they headed to Bara parish <sup>(<a href="#2D">2D</a>)</sup>. Back in Södra Sallerup parish, his occupation is listed as a former volunteer and worker (f.d. Volontair Arbetare). This may be reference to his time as a draftee, and his status as an unskilled laborer, but as I am not fluent in 1900s Swedish, I am not sure <sup>(<a href="#2E">2E</a>)</sup>.</p>

<p>On this same page as Nils is listed, Emma’s family and her previous entry as Jons Sandqvist’s and Anna Nilsdotter’s daughter can be seen. In contrast with Nils Landgren’s occupation of “f.d. volontair,” Jons’ occupation is listed as “f.d. Soldat.” I’m not sure what the difference is between the two, but there does seem to be a distinction and Jons does not have an enrollment number. They are, however, both recorded as current Arbetares or workers of some sort. There is an unidentifiable word that has been applied to Nils’ occupation in other household examination records as well as to Jons’ on this page. It seems to start with “Krit” but I cannot parse it <sup>(<a href="#2E">2E</a>)</sup>. The same word is used in Nils’ emmigration record <sup>(<a href="#5">5</a>)</sup> which is listed as “Kritbruksarb” on the index entry for this record <sup>(<a href="#12">12</a>]</sup>. As “-arb” is most likely an abbreviation of arbetare, the last part of the word “-bruksarbetare” would therefore mean <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Swedish_Genealogical_Word_List">foundryman or iron worker</a>, which corresponds with the jobs he had in America. The “Krit-“ portion, however, is still a mystery. It may be related to the word “krita” or chalk used for drawing or sketching, but that seems odd. <a href="https://www.jernkontoret.se/en/the-steel-industry/the-history-of-swedish-steel-industry/">History of the Swedish Iron and Steel Industry</a></p>

<p>Nils is recorded as having arrived in Tullstorp #4, Södra Sallerup on the 12th of April. Less than a month later he marries Emma Sandqvist on the 1st of May, 1907, as recorded in the Tullstorp #4 household examination record <sup>(<a href="#2E">2E</a>)</sup> and their marriage record <sup>(<a href="#3">3</a>)</sup>. The same day as their marriage they are recorded as leaving Södra Sallerup and moving to Limhamn village/farm in the parish of Hyllie <sup>(<a href="#2E">2E</a>)</sup>.</p>

<p>They arrive in Limhamn seven days after their wedding. Five months later their first child, Anna Paulina Landgren, is born in Limhamn on the 9th of October, 1907 <sup>(<a href="#2F">2F</a>)</sup>. This, combined with Nils’ abrupt appearance in Tullstorp and subsequent marriage, suggests that they married because of Emma’s pregnancy. Tullstorp, Södra Sallerup and Sunnanå, Burlöv are not very far apart from each other at all, so their meeting is fairly likely. In contrast to these areas, Limhamn, Hyllie, is much closer to the city center, a likely spot for newly weds to try to make a life.</p>

<p>INSERT PHOTO HERE</p>

<p>They moved back to Södra Sallerup #4 on the 8th of February 1910, a little less than a year later on the 14th of January 1911, their son Knut Toge Arnold Landgren was born <sup>(<a href="#2H">2H</a>)</sup>. In 1911 they moved to Tullstorp #5, Södra Sallerup <sup>(<a href="#2I">2I</a>)</sup>. This record mentions that they move away from Tullstorp #5 but no date is recorded indicating when they moved. It does mention that the corresponding record is in the next household examination book on page 281. However, this book is not yet available.</p>

<p>Nils is recorded as being a former volunteer in the first Limhamn record <sup>(<a href="2F">2F</a>)</sup>, and a general worker (arb.) in the second Limhamn record <sup>(<a href="#2G">2G</a>)</sup>. The last two records have Nils’ occupation as a Kritbruksarbetare <sup>(<a href="#2H">2H</a>, <a href="#2I">2I</a>)</sup>.</p>

<p>There is currently a gap between the household examination records and their immigration records of about three years. However, it is unlikely they traveled outside of the Södra Sallerup parish during this time as it is their last permanent residence as recorded on his emigration record <sup>(<a href="#4">4</a>)</sup>. They left on the ship Öresundsångare on the 27th of January, 1914 from the port at the city of Malmö and traveled to Liverpool, England <sup>(<a href="#5">5</a>)</sup> where the boarded the Lusitania, arriving in New York on the 6th of February 1914 <sup>(<a href="#4">4</a>)</sup>. Their final desitination is listed as Winnebago County, Illinois on both the Swedish Emigration record <sup>(<a href="#5">5</a>)</sup> and the New York Passenger List <sup>(<a href="#4">4</a>)</sup>.</p>

<p>The following year in 1915 they are living in Rockford, when Erick Landgren is born. A year later Mary L. Landgren is born. By 1919, Nils and Emma have made a home at 1339 6th Av. in Rockford, Illinois and Nils is working as a “hammer helper” at RDF Co. at this time <sup>(<a href="#7">7</a>)</sup>. In the 1920 Census <sup>(<a href="#7">7</a>)</sup> he is listed as a blacksmith working in the machine shop industry. The family is also recorded as living with three other Swedish immigrants: Axle Josephson, Otto Carlson, and William Hugo Matthison. A year later, on the 12th of April 1921 he becomes a natuarlized citizen.</p>

<p>By 1929 he is no longer living with Emma Landgren according to the listing in the Rockford Directories <sup>(<a href="#12">12</a>)</sup>. After this date, the records get fuzzy as to which Nils Peter Landgren is the subject of the census or otherwise. However, by 1942, as evidenced by his World War II Draft Registration Card <sup>(<a href="#13">13</a>)</sup> he is listed as living at 2581 1/2 N. Clark St in Chicago and working for George Svalos on 2553 N. Clark St. He lists his daughter, Anna, as the person who will always know his address. Fourteen years later his death is recorded in Winnebago County, Illinois as the 18th of March, 1956 <sup>(<a href="#10">10</a>)</sup>. I have yet to find a record of his burial.</p>
