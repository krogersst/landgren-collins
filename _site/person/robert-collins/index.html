<p>Spielberg does justice to this side of extraterrestrial legends as well, presenting these experiences with tongue-in-cheek humor at times, or with all of the emotional strength that these legend trips can inspire. For example, Roy stumbles upon a group of UFO hunters sitting on a hill, where the mood is expectant. In fact, the UFOs are presented as reality during this scene and the UFO hunting legend trip is successful at the surface level: they have gathered at the hill to see UFOs and indeed they have seen UFOs. The experience is transformative for both Roy and the other spectators at the hill. The next night Roy purposefully joins in on the UFO hunting, as does a larger crowd. The air of this scene is more lighthearted, a sort of block party atmosphere with board games and children running everywhere. The UFOs seem to arrive again and an old man holds up the classic ‘we come in peace’ sign. But this time helicopters are the source of the lights, and the UFO hunters scatter. But this does not mean the legend trip has failed. Even though they haven’t found their UFOs, the legend is fed through government intervention and rumor. The differences in mood created by Spielberg provides important information about the varieties of extraterrestrial experience and it is closely tied to real narratives of UFO hunting. Just as Bill Ellis explains legends as naming the unnamed as a result of anxiety of unknown experiences when legend trips exist in a sort of limbo state between proven experience and the unknown, the emotions generated are awe and wonder. When the legend trip ends in easily explained events, this emotional power is diminished as is the credibility of the legend itself. Thus the legend trip is always on the tipping point, as Bill Ellis discusses in his book Aliens, Ghosts, and Cults: Legends We Live. He states,</p>
