      <p>The only evidence of Benjamin’s existence I have found so far is in compilations of lineages. I am still looking for corroborating records, as there seems to be a few as his public service is well documented. The main record I would like to get access to is the will that gives evidence of his wife’s identity and his children. At least this has been trasncribed in part <sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.

<p>As his parentage is disputed in <em>Descendants of Joseph Greene of Westerly, R.I</em>, I have been hesitant in listing John and Joan Greene as part of this lineage so far. However, <em>The Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island</em> seems rather unambigous about Benjamin’s lineage, giving me some hope in the connection being possible.</p>
