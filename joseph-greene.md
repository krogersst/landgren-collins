*Birthplace is reported as "probably in East Greenwich" by Greene <sup>[3](#3)</sup>, this is located in the same county as the reported birthplace of Warwick in the Rhode Island Vital Extracts <sup>[1](#1)</sup>. Similarly, only the birth year of "about 1725" is recorded by Greene<sup>[3](#3)</sup>. This is within 3 years of the Rhode Island Vital Extracts' record.<sup>[1](#1)</sup>

+Place of death and burial is recorded as probably Berlin, New York by Greene <sup>[3](#3)</sup> with no date given, suggesting that no records of this have been preserved. The Find A Grave record <sup>[4](#4)</sup> has this information recorded although no photographs of the associated gravestone is published at this time.
