In the 1900 census, Dorothea is listed as having immigrated to the United States in the year 1855 <sup>([6](#6))</sup>.

At some point after the 1880 census, Gottfried followed his son to Linn County, Oregon where he passed away in 1893 and was buried in the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. Four years later, on the 8th of June, 1897, she marries Edwin Stratton <sup>([5](#5))</sup> and the two move to Richford, Waushara County, Wisconsin by the 1900 census <sup>([6](#6))</sup>. The census records the two of them being married for 45 years (placing their marriage as the same year as Dorothea's immigration), although it is clearly recorded as 1897 in the Wisconsin marriage index <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. In addition Edwin is [buried](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/86805273) in 1908 beside his previous wife, whose death was in 1892. I can find no record of Dorothea's death or burial as of yet.
