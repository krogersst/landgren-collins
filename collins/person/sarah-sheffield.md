Sarah's family moved to White Rock, Ogle County, Illinois by 1860 to live with her uncle Newman’s family <sup>([1](#1))</sup>. Her father worked as a wagon maker while her uncle worked as a farmer. By the 1870 census, Sarah and her immediate family had moved to New Milford, Winnebago County, Illinois <sup>([2](#2))</sup>.

There is a marriage record for Sarah Sheffield in Rock County, Wisconsin for the 1st of July, 1873. Her spouse is not listed, but considering her family had lived near Rock County around that time, and the timing would make sense for a marriage, this is a likely record for her marriage to William Allen. There is also a corresponding record in the same volume on the same page for a William Alden, most likely a transcription error <sup>([9](#9))</sup>. Additionally, the year matches up with marriage year given in the 1900 census <sup>([4](#4))</sup>.

In the 1880 census, Sarah and William Allen’s family was living at 501 Main St, Rockford, Illinois <sup>([3](#3))</sup>. Eight years later in 1888, [May Allen]({{ /collins/person/may-allen | relative_url }}) was born. A gap in records exists until the 1900 census, where the family was living at 903 West State Street, Rockford, Illinois <sup>([4](#4))</sup>.  In the 1910 census, the family was living at 825 West State Street, Rockford, Illinois <sup>([8](#8))</sup>. Nine years later on the 17th of December, 1919, Sarah Sheffield Allen died at the age of 68 <sup>([5](#5))</sup>. In the death index record, her parents are listed as Daniel Shefield and Mary Blakely, both of which are stated as being born in England.
