Newman Preston Blakeley was born in Cohocton, Steuben County, New York to Francis Harwood Blakeley and Elizabeth Pauline Blakeley.

Mary Blakely married Daniel Sheffield around 1840 in New York. In 1845 she gave birth to Warren Sheffield, and in 1848 she gave birth to Franklin/Francis Sheffield. By 1850, the family was living in Wayland, Steuben County, New York. Meanwhile her brother, Newman Blakely was living with their parents, Francis Blakely and Elizabeth Blakely, in Cohocton, Steuben County, New York.

By 1855, Newman was living in Ogle County, Illinois, where he married Hannah Baird on the 15th of August.

Mary and Daniel moved to White Rock, Ogle County, Illinois by 1860 with their three children (Warren, Francis, and Sarah) to live with Mary’s brother Newman’s family. Daniel worked as a wagon maker while Newman worked as a farmer. Newman joined the 52nd Regiment, Illinois Infantry in Rockford in the Civil War and died in battle in Georgia in 1864.

By 1870 Mary’s family had moved to Winnebago County.

By 1860 Francis and Elizabeth Blakeley were living in Scott, Ogle, Illinois with the Ruketon family. In 1870 they were living on their own in the same place. Five years later, Francis died.

At some point, Elizabeth and Francis Harwood Blakeley moved to Rockford. They are buried in the Beach family cemetery in [Stillman Valley, Ogle County, Illinois](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75626235).
