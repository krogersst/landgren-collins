Robert Collins was born in Milton, Wisconsin on the 6th of September, 1885 <sup>([5](#5), [8](#8), [10](#10), [11](#11))</sup>. By 1900, the family had moved to Edgerton, Wisconsin 9 miles away <sup>([1](#1))</sup>. On the 27th of October, 1906, Robert married his first wife, Viola Manley, in Winnebago County, Illinois <sup>([3](#3))</sup>. It is safe to say that by 1906 they had moved to Rockford, Illinois, where they show up in the 1910 Census <sup>([2](#2))</sup>. Between 1906 and 1914 it is assumed that he divorced Viola Manley, so that on the 21st of March, 1914 he married May Allen in Lake County, Indiana, just across the Illinois/Indiana Border up by Chicago <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. In 1917, he is drafted in World War I. His draft card records the couple as living at 1006 Kelburn in Rockford, and Robert's occupation as a stove mounter at the Eclipse Stove Comapny <sup>([5](#5), [7](#7))</sup>. Around that time they have their first child, Roberta Collins <sup>([6](#6))</sup>.

By 1920, they are living at 714 Chestnut in Rockford and Robert is still working at the same job <sup>([6](#6), [7](#7))</sup>. By 1924, they have moved to 1019 Peach, Rockford <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. A gap in records I have been able to find so far exists, but by 1935 he has married Minnie M. Brown from Missouri, and now lives at 1116 2nd Avenue. They live at this address for at least a decade <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. In 1942, he is registered in World War II in the Fourth Registration, also called the "Old Man's Draft," because it registered men who were 45 to 64 years old (from Fold3.com). His card records his employer as Mansfried Carlin at 306 7th St., Rockford. His hair has since gone gray according to the card <sup>([10](#10))</sup>.

In October 1976 Robert Collins dies in Rockford, Illinois. The only record I can find for his death is his Social Security Death Index entry <sup>([11](#11))</sup> which gives his date of death only as specific as the month.
