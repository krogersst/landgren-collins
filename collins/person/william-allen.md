There is a marriage record for Sarah Sheffield in Rock County, Wisconsin for the 1st of July, 1873. Her spouse is not listed, but considering her family had lived near Rock County around that time, and the timing would make sense for a marriage, this is a likely record for her marriage to William Allen. There is a corresponding record in the same volume on the same page for a William Alden, most likely a transcription error <sup>((#7)[7])</sup>. Additionally, the year matches up with marriage year given in the 1900 census <sup>([2](#2))</sup>.

In the 1880 census, William and Sarah Allen's family was living at 501 Main St, Rockford, Illinois. His occupation was listed as a laborer <sup>([1](#1))</sup>. Eight years later in 1888, [May Allen]({{ '/collins/person/may-allen' | relative_url }}) was born. A gap in records exists until the 1900 census, where the family was living at 903 West State Street, Rockford, Illinois and William was now working as an engineer <sup>([2](#2))</sup>. In the 1910 census, the family was living at 825 West State Street, Rockford, Illinois. William was working as a building manager for Ashton Building <sup>([3](#3))</sup>. Accoridng to the 1920 census, the family was living at 712 Chestnut Street, Rockford, Illinois. William was working as an electrician at this time <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. In the 1940 census, William Allen was living with his son Sidney Allen and his family at 310 North 3rd Street, Rockford, Illinois <sup>([5](#5))</sup>. By April 1941 he was living at 1019 Crosby St., Rockford, Illinois <sup>([6](#6))</sup>. The death index listed his occupation as a stationary engineer. He passed way at the age of 92 <sup>([6](#6))</sup>.
