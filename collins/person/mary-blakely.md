Mary Blakely married Daniel Sheffield around 1840 in New York. In 1845 she gave birth to Warren Sheffield, and in 1848 she gave birth to Franklin/Francis Sheffield. By 1850, the family was living in Wayland, Steuben County, New York <sup>([2](#2))</sup>. Meanwhile her brother, Newman Blakely was living with their parents, Francis Blakely (b. ~1779, Massachusets) and Elizabeth Blakely (b. ~1800, New York), in Cohocton, Steuben County, New York <sup>([1](#1))</sup>. By 1855, Newman was living in Ogle County, Illinois, where he married Hannah Baird on the 15th of August <sup>([5](#5))</sup>.

Mary and Daniel soon followed Newman, and moved to White Rock, Ogle County, Illinois by 1860 with their three children (Warren, Francis, and Sarah) to live with Mary’s brother Newman’s family. Daniel worked as a wagon maker while Newman worked as a farmer <sup>([3](#3))</sup>. Mary and Newman's parents, Francis and Elizabeth Blakeley also moved to Ogle County, Illinois by 1860. They lived with the Ruketon family in Scott according to the census <sup>([7](#7))</sup>.

Newman joined the 52nd Regiment, Illinois Infantry in Rockford in the Civil War and died in battle in Georgia in 1864 <sup>([6](#6))</sup>. Newman Blakely is buried in [Antioch Cemetery, Marietta, Cobb County, Georgia](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/121815470).

By 1870 Mary’s immediate family had moved to Winnebago County, where Daniel was working as a wheelwright <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. From here Mary and Daniel's records peter out. Her parents however, were now living on their own in Scott, Ogle County, Illinois in 1870 <sup>([8](#8))</sup>. Five years later Francis, died in 1875, supposedly at sea. Eight years after his death, Elizabeth died in 1883. They are buried in the Beach family cemetery in [Stillman Valley, Ogle County, Illinois](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75626235).
