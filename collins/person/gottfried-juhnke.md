Overview of Nakel during this time period.

Evangelische Kirche Nakel (Evangelical Church of Nakel), Kreis Wirsitz (Wirsitz County), Deutschland (now Nakło nad Notecią, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland)

It appears that their eldest son Gustav left home and married Augusta Amelia Hundt in Emerald, Faribault County, Minnesota on the 20th of August, 1882 <sup>([5](#5))</sup>. They moved to Linn County, Oregon sometime before the birth of their son, Albert Sam Juhnke on the 11th of February, 1891. The family was living at PO Box 2560 A., Sweet Home, Oregon at this time <sup>([6](#6))</sup>. That same year Gustav died at the age of 32 and was buried in the IOOF Odd Fellows Cemetery in Lebanon, Linn County, Oregon <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. According to an article in the Lebanon Express, he drowned in the Santiam while bathing <sup>([10](#10))</sup>. Three years later, Gottfried was buried next to him in 1893 <sup>([8](#8))</sup>. There are no records indicating Gottfried followed his son to Oregon other than what is likely his headstone. There was a small mining revival in the area during that time, from around 1888 to 1892, which could explain their original reason for moving there <sup>([9](#9))</sup>.
