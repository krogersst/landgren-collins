The Juhnkes immigrated from Pomerania between their marriage in 1845 and their first son's birth in 1858. Dorothea Draeger's immigration is recorded as being in 1855 in the 1900 census, which if true, places the family as immigrating at the beginning of the first wave (1855-1870) of the [Kashubian diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashubian_diaspora), a group of Poles from the Pomeranian region. Kashubian emigrants settled in Wisconsin from the very beginning of the migration.
