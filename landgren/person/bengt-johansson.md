Bengt Johansson was possibly born in Kohagahus, Halmstad parish, Malmöhus county to Johan Andersson on the 25th of May, 1770 sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. The parish name and year matches up with his later entries in the household parish records however the month and year do not, but considering that his month and year aren't written down until much later, they may not be wholly accurate themselves.

The family next shows up in their first son's birth record and the 1796-1802 record for Stubbarp, Gödelöv parish <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>. By this point Bengt has presumably married Marna Carlsdotter who was born sometime in Växjö parish, Kronoberg County (Småland), in the 1805-1810 parish record, her birthplace is recorded as Växjö <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>, while in following years it is listed as Småland, the general province where Växjö is located. Her birth date was never recorded in these household records.

[Johan Bengtsson]({{ '/landgren/person/johan-bengtsson' | relative_link }}) was born on the 26th of July, 1792 to Marna Carlsdotter and Bengt Johansson in Stubbarp, Gödelöv parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. Johan lived in Stubbarp, Gödelöv parish with his family until he left in 1810 <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup> to spend a year in Kyrkoköpinge parish before returning home <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. The family then moved to Genarp No. 11 1/4 in 1812 where Johan presumably met his future wife [Hanna Ohlsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/hanna-ohlsdotter' | relative_link }}) <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>.

Bengt and Marna lived in Genarp No. 11 1/4, Genarp parish for another 19 years before they moved to Sjöledhus, Genarp in 1831 <sup>([1L](#1L))</sup>. Two years later, Marna passed away in 1833 <sup>([1L](#1L))</sup>. Four years after her death, Bengt also passed away on the 14th of April, 1837 at the age of 57 <sup>([1M](#1M))</sup>.
