Johan Bengtsson was born on the 26th of July, 1792 to Marna Carlsdotter and Bengt Johansson in Stubbarp, Gödelöv parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. Johan lived in Stubbarp, Gödelöv parish with his family until he left in 1810 <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup> to spend a year in Kyrkoköpinge parish before returning home <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>. The family then moved to Genarp No. 11 1/4 in 1812 where Johan presumably met his future wife <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup> When Johan married [Hanna Ohlsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/hanna-ohlsdotter' | relative_link }}) around 1815, he moved to her family's farm or village in Espet and the two of them stayed there until Johan's death <sup>([1G](#1G), [1N](#1N))</sup>.

On October 27, 1815, their first daughter, Elna Johansdotter was born in Espethus, Genarp parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>. When she was two years old she was sent to live with Hanna's parents Ola Fredricksson and Kjerstina Larsdotter in Skogledhus in Genarp parish <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>. Two years later, in 1820, she was living once again with her parents in Espehus <sup>([1I](#1I))</sup>. She lived with her family in Espehus/Espet 13 until sometime in the mid 1830s <sup>([1K](#1K))</sup>. Johan continued to live in Espet until his death. On the 6th of September, 1857, Johan Bengtsson passed away at the age of 45<sup>([1N](#1N))</sup>.
