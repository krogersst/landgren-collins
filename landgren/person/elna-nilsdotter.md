Elna Nilsdotter is recorded on every household examination record as having a birthplace of Bara parish, however I cannot find any corroborating records, such as a household examination record featuring her with her parents or an entry in the parish birth books in 1825. She probably moved to Lyngby parish at some point where she lived until 1842 when she moved to Bara No. 1 7/8 farm in Bara parish <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. On December 16, 1845, she gives birth to Karna Nildotter out of wedlock <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup> and in 1846 she marries [Ola Nilsson]({{ '/landgren/person/ola-nilsson' | relative_url }}). Karna is not shown to be his daughter, but there is no conclusive proof either way. By 1846 Ola and Elna are married and living in Engagården village/farm in Bara parish where they remained for five years <sup>([1C](#1C), [1D](#1D))</sup> before spending a year in Barahus <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>, and another year in Torup <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>.

They returned once again to Engagården in 1853 and spent the next several decades there <sup>([1G](#1G), [1H](#1H), [1I](#1I), [1J](#1J), [2A](#2A))</sup>. During this time, [Jöns Olof Olsson]({{ '/landgren/person/jons-sandqvist' | relative_url }}) was born on the 2nd of July, 1865 to Elna and Ola <sup>([3](#3))</sup>. 15 years later, on the 4th of November, 1880, Jöns moved away from home in Engagården. Three years later Ola and Elna moved to Bara No. 20/Barahus <sup>([2B](#2B))</sup>, where Ola eventually died in 1888 on the 3rd of February <sup>([2C](#2C))</sup>. Seven years later on the 10th of April, 1895, Elna also passes away <sup>([2D](#2D))</sup>.
