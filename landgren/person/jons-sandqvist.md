Jöns Olof Olsson was born on the 2nd of July, 1865 to [Elna Nilsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/elna-nilsdotter' | relative_url }}) and [Ola Nilsson]({{ '/landgren/person/ola-nilsson' | relative_url }}) in Bara parish in Malmöhus county <sup>([1](#1))</sup>. On the 4th of November, 1880 Jöns moved away from home in the village of Engagården to live in Bara No. 5, Bara, Malmöhus <sup>([2A](#2A), [2B](#2B))</sup>. He then moved to Burlöv on the 24th of October, 1881 <sup>([2B](#2B))</sup>. On the 14th of November, 1882, Jöns and Anders Andersson moved from Burlöv to "Tullstorp No. 1 4/15 mt.," Södra Sallerup parish, Malmöhus county until Jöns moved away on the 6th of November, 1883  <sup>([5A](#5A))</sup>. Four days later, on the 10th of November, 1883, Jöns arrived in Gässie No. 21, Gässie, Malmöhus where he lived until the 18th of October, 1884 when he moved to No.8 Kvarnby, Husie, Malmöhus  <sup>([2C](#2C), [2D](#2D))</sup>. After that he moved around Husie until 1887 when he leaves on the 7th of May, 1887 <sup>([2D](#2D), [2E](#2E), [2F](#2F))</sup> and arrives in Djurslöf No.9, Tottarp parish, Malmöhus seven days later on the 14th of May, 1887. He is first recorded here with his soldier name Sandqvist <sup>([5B](#5B))</sup>.

On the 30th of March, 1889 he marries [Anna Nilsdotter]({{ 'landgren/person/anna-nilsdotter' | relative_url }}) <sup>([3](#3))</sup>, however he doesn't move from Tottarp parish to their new home in Qvarby #7, Södra Sallerup, Malmöhus until the 23rd of August, 1889 <sup>([2G](#2G))</sup>. Nine months after their marriage, their first daughter, [Emma Sandqvist]({{ '/landgren/person/emma-sandqvist' | relative_url }}) was born on December 31st, 1889 <sup>([2G](#2G))</sup>. The family lived in Qvarnby #7 from 1889 to 1895 <sup>([2G](#2G))</sup> before they moved to Tullstorp #4 <sup>([2H](#2H))</sup>. Emma lived with her family in Tullstorp until 1906 when she married [Nils Peter Landgren]({{ '/landgren/person/nils-landgren' | relative_url }}) <sup>([2I](#2I))</sup>. Here the records available online drop off. Anna and Jöns seem to have stayed in the same place since 1895, until Anna passes away in No. 4 Tullstorp, Södra Sallerup, Malmöhus in 1938. Four years later, Jöns dies in S. Sallerup 3 on the 3rd of February, 1942 <sup>([4](#4))</sup>.
