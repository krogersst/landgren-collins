Kjerstina's birth record is odd. It lists her father as Christen Larsson and her mother as Marna Ohlsdotter, while her witnesses are listed as Pehr Pahlsson and Elna Johnsdotter <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. However, in the household examination record covering her birth, Pehr and Marna are listed as married while Elna and Christen are listed as Kjerstina's parents <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. I'm unsure if the birth record simply mixed up the mother's and female witness' names or if there was an affair. I am inclined to believe it was a mistake in the birth record and that [Christen Larsson]({{ '/landgren/person/christen-larsson' | relative_url }}) and [Elna Johnsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/elna-johnsdotter' | relative_url }}) are her birth parents.

The family lived in Grentinge No. 3 1/4 village or farm in Genarp parish, Malmöhus county during the time of Kjerstina's birth. Two years after she was born they moved to Hafslemölla village/farm in 1844 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. On the 27th of June, 1847, Kjerstina's father, Christen Larsson, died. A year after, her mother married Daniel Hansson on the 16th of October, 1848 <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>.
