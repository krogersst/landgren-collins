Christen Larsson was born on the 31 of May, 1815 to [Lars Pahlsson]({{ "/landgren/person/lars-pahlsson" | relative_url }}) and [Karna Jonsdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/karna-jonsdotter" | relative_url }}) in Rockarp, Genarp parish, Malmöhus county. The family lived in Rockarp 1 1/4 in Genarp parish <sup>([1B](#1B), [1C](#1C))</sup> until 1821 when they moved to Ttegelbrukshus A of Nydamshus in Genarp <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup>. Christen moved away from home in 1825 <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>.

By 1837 he has married [Elna Johansdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/elna-johnsdotter' | relative_url }}) and the two of them are living in Grentinge No. 3 1/4 in Genarp Parish <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>. In 1842, their first daughter [Kjerstina Christensdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/kjerstina-christensdotter" | relative_url }}) was born on the 16th of May, 1842.
Kjerstina's birth record is odd. It lists her father as Christen Larsson and her mother as Marna Ohlsdotter, while her witnesses are listed as Pehr Pahlsson and Elna Johnsdotter <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. However, in the household examination record covering her birth, Pehr and Marna are listed as married while Elna and Christen are listed as Kjerstina's parents <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. I'm unsure if the birth record simply mixed up the mother's and female witness' names or if there was an affair. I am inclined to believe it was a mistake in the birth record and that [Elna Johnsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/elna-johnsdotter' | relative_url }}) is indeed her birth mother.

Two years after she was born they moved to Hafslemölla village/farm in 1844. On the 27th of June, 1847, Kjerstina's father, Christen Larsson, died. A year after, her mother married Daniel Hansson on the 16th of October, 1848 <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>.
