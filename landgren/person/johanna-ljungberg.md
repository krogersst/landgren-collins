Johanna was born on the 23rd of April, 1848 to [Peter Ljungberg]({{ "/landgren/person/peter-ljungberg" | relative_url }}) and [Boel Andersdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/boel-andersdotter" | relative_url }}) in Torup in Bara parish. Johanna's father died when she was seven in 1855 <sup>([3B](#3B))</sup>. Three years later, the family moved to Tromberga, Bara in 1858 <sup>([3B](#3B))</sup>. On the 29th of December, 1858, her mother remarried to Henrik Larsson <sup>([6](#6))</sup>.

From 1862 to 1866 the family was living in Tranberga-gard #10 before Johanna moved away in 1866 to Barahus to live by herself <sup>([3C](#3C))</sup>. She was listed as "inhyses" or a lodger <sup>([3D](#3D))</sup>, usually one living cost free. According to the 1862-1867 parish record, she was living in the house of the widow Jeppa Persson <sup>([3C](#3C))</sup>. After three years or so, she returned to live with her mother in Tromberga #10 on the 6th of November, 1869 <sup>([3E](#3E))</sup>. Five years after her return, the entire family moved back to Torupshus on the 9th of November, 1874 <sup>([3F](#3F))</sup>.

Once in Torupshus, Johanna had her first daughter, Karna Mathilda, out of wedlock <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. In the 1867-1874 parish record, Karna Mathilda was listed as Johanna's daughter, born on the 2nd of December, 1878 <sup>([3G](#3G))</sup>. The corresponding birth index entry for Karna only listed Johanna as her mother, no father was listed <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. This happened one year before Johanna's marriage to [Lars Nilsson Landgren]({{ "/landgren/person/lars-lindgren" | relative_url }}), on the 30th of December, 1879 <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. Lars doesn't officially move to Torupshus until November, and he had previously been living around 60 km away <sup>([3H](#3H))</sup>. Three years after their marriage, they had their first son, [Nils Peter Landgren]({{ "/landgren/person/nils-landgren" | relative_url }}).

Lars and Johanna continued to live in Torupshus until Lars literally "ran away" on the 12th of November, 1890 <sup>([2A](#2A))</sup>. Twelve years later, Johanna died on the 13th of June, 1902 <sup>([2B](#2B), [5](#5))</sup>. In her death record, she is listed as the wife of a "husman" or farmer, specifically in the style of small scale tenure farming or "crofter" <sup>([5](#5))</sup>. As such, husfolk usually owned their house but not the land they farmed. Her cause of death is quite surprising once I attempted to translate it. The first word is possibly "olyckshändelse" which means an accident or incident. The second word is possibly "vådaskott" which means a shot that hits an unwanted target. The third word or set of words is a little more difficult to parse. It seems to imply some sort of unlawful activity, with the beginning portion of the word but I can't figure out a more concrete translation.
