In her death record, she is listed as the wife of a "husman" or farmer (specifically in the style of small scale tenure farming or "crofter") <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. Husfolk would usually owned their house but not the land they farmed. Her cause of death is quite surprising once I attempted to translate it. The first word is possibly "olyckshändelse" which means an accident or incident. The second word is possibly "vådaskott" which means a shot that hits an unwanted target. The third word or set of words is a little more difficult to parse. It seems to imply some sort of unlawful activity, with the beginning portion  but I can't figure out a more concrete translation.
