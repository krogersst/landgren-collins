Johanna's father, [Peter Ljungberg]({{ "/landgren/person/peter-ljungberg" | relative_url }}), died when she was seven in 1855. Three years later, the family moves to Tromberga, Bara in 1858 <sup>([3B](#3B))</sup>. On the 29th of December, 1858, her mother marries Henrik Larsson <sup>([6](#6))</sup>.

From 1862 to 1866 the family is living in Tranberga-gard No. 10. Johanna moves in 1866 to Barahus to live by herself <sup>([3C](#3C))</sup>. She is listed as "inhyses" or a lodger <sup>([3D](#3D))</sup>, usually one living cost free. According to the 1862-1867 parish record <sup>([3C](#3C))</sup>, she is living in the house of the widow Jeppa Persson. After three years or so, she returns to live with her mother in Tromberga #10 on the 6th of November, 1869 <sup>([3E](#3E))</sup>. Five years after her return, the entire family moves back to Torupshus on the 9th of November, 1874 <sup>([3F](#3F))</sup>.

Once in Torupshus, Johanna has her first daughter, Karna Mathilda, out of wedlock. In the 1867-1874 parish record, Karna Mathilda is listed as Johanna's daughter, born on the 2nd of December, 1878 <sup>([3G](#3G))</sup>. The corresponding birth index entry for Karna only lists Johanna as her mother, no father is listed<sup>([7](#7))</sup>. This happens one year before Johanna's marriage to Lars Nilsson Landgren, on the 30th of December, 1879 <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. Lars doesn't officially move to Torupshus until November, and he had previously been living in Munkarp, around 60 km away <sup>([3H](#3H))</sup>. Three years after their marriage, they have [Nils Peter Landgren]({{ "/landgren/person/nils-landgren" | relative_url }}).

Lars and Johanna continued to live in Torupshus until Lars literally "ran away" on the 12th of November, 1890 <sup>([2A](#2A))</sup>. Twelve years later, Johanna dies on the 13th of June, 1902 <sup>([2B](#2B), [5](#5))</sup>. In her death record, she is listed as the wife of a "husman" or farmer, specifically in the style of small scale tenure farming or "crofter" <sup>([5](#5))</sup>. As such, husfolk usually owned their house but not the land they farmed. Her cause of death is quite surprising once I attempted to translate it. The first word is possibly "olyckshändelse" which means an accident or incident. The second word is possibly "vådaskott" which means a shot that hits an unwanted target. The third word or set of words is a little more difficult to parse. It seems to imply some sort of unlawful activity, with the beginning portion of the word but I can't figure out a more concrete translation.
