On May 15, 1791 Hanna Ohlsdotter was born to Kjerstina Larsdotter and Ola Fredricksson in Genarp parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. Hanna lived in Espehus in Genarp parish from birth and through her first marriage <sup>([1B](#1B), [1L](#1L))</sup>. When she married [Johan Bengtsson]({{ '/landgren/person/johan-bengtsson' | relative_url }}) around 1815, he moved to her family's farm or village and the two of them stayed there until Johan's death <sup>([1E](#1E), [1L](#1L))</sup>.

On October 27, 1815, their first daughter, Elna Johansdotter was born in Espethus, Genarp parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. When she was two years old she was sent to live with Hanna's parents Ola Fredricksson and Kjerstina Larsdotter in Skogledhus in Genarp parish <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>. Two years later, in 1820, she was living once again with her parents in Espehus <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>. She lived with her family in Espehus/Espet 13 until sometime in the mid 1830s <sup>([1L](#1L))</sup>.

On the 6th of September, 1857, Hanna's husband Johan, passed away <sup>([1L](#1L))</sup>. It is possible she later married an Anders Larsson and moved to Lund the next year in 1858 <sup>([1M](#1M))</sup>.
