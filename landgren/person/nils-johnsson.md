Nils Johnsson was born on the 14th of September, 1816 to [John Pehrsson]({{ "/landgren/person/john-pehrsson" | relative_url }}) and Pernilla Mansdotter in Maglasäte in <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. His mother died when he was seven years old on the 25th of December, 1822. His father remarried in 1824 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. He lived with his father in Maglasäte No. 6 until he was 12 years old when he showed up in Ekeröd No. 3 in Höör parish where he was listed under a section entitled Frälse. Holma insockne <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup>. I am unsure what this desginates and all I can gather is that frälse probably refers to land taxation and nobility as discussed on the [SweGGate StarGuide](http://sites.rootsweb.com/~swewgw/Geogr/thGeoLand00.htm#Fr%C3%A4lse). Holma is a place name and insokne is a word of inhabitant of a parish. I am eager to know what Frälse. means in this context as Nils had left home at 12 years old to live by himself. It looks like at this point he had also met his future wife, [Hanna Nilsdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/hanna-nilsdotter" | relative_url }}) as she was listed just above him in the same parish record <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup>.

In 1836 Nils moved to Sjunnerup No. 2 3/8 and was recorded under the heading of Insokne Frälse or inhabitant of the tax-exempt farm <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>. In 1837 he was listed in Ekeröd No. 1 1/2 under Uts: Frälse or "out" of the tax-exempt farm <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. He stayed in Ekeröd until 1839 <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup> when he moved to Tollerup in Höör parish where he lived for a year <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>. He then married Hanna Nilsdotter and left Tollerup to live with her in Stenshus, Sjunnerup in Höör parish <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>. Thirteen years later, their son [Lars Nilsson]({{ "/landgren/person/lars-nilsson" | relative_url }}) was born on the 23rd of February, 1853 <sup>([2](#2))</sup>. When Lars was fourteen, Nils died on the 16th of November, 1867 at the age of 51 <sup>([1N](#1N))</sup>. He had lived in Sjunnerup for the last 27 years of his life.
