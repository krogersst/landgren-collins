Nils Johnsson was born on the 14th of September, 1816 to [John Pehrsson]({{ "/landgren/person/john-pehrsson" | relative_url }}) and Pernilla Mansdotter in Maglasäte in Höör parish <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. His mother died when he was seven years old on the 25th of December, 1822. His father remarried in 1824 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. He lived with his father in Maglasäte No. 6 until he was 12 years old when he showed up in Ekeröd No. 3 in Höör parish where he was listed under a section entitled Frälse. Holma insockne <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup>. I am unsure what this desginates and all I can gather is that frälse probably refers to land taxation and nobility as discussed on the [SweGGate StarGuide](http://sites.rootsweb.com/~swewgw/Geogr/thGeoLand00.htm#Fr%C3%A4lse). Holma is a place name and insokne is a word of inhabitant of a parish. I am eager to know what Frälse. means in this context as Nils had left home at 12 years old to live by himself.

In 1836 Nils moved to Sjunnerup No. 2 3/8 and was recorded under the heading of Insokne Frälse or inhabitant of the tax-exempt farm <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>. In 1837 he was listed in Ekeröd No. 1 1/2 under Uts: Frälse or "out" of the tax-exempt farm <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. He stayed in Ekeröd until 1839 <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup> when he moved to Tollerup in Höör parish where he lived for a year <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>. He then married Hanna Nilsdotter (b. 1/23/1813 in Höör) and left Tollerup to live with her in Stenshus, Sjunnerup in Höör parish <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>. Thirteen years later, their son [Lars Nilsson]({{ "/landgren/person/lars-nilsson" | relative_url }}) was born on the 23rd of February, 1853 <sup>([2](#2))</sup>. When Lars was fourteen, Nils died on the 16th of November, 1867 in Sjunnerup, Höör at the age of 51 <sup>([1N](#1N))</sup>.  Six years later, his wife Hanna died on the 7th of April, 1874 <sup>([1O](#1O))</sup>.
