On October 27, 1815, Elna Johansdotter was born to [Hanna Ohlsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/hanna-ohlsdotter' | relative_url }}) and [Johan Bengtsson]({{ '/landgren/person/johan-bengtsson' | relative_url }}) in Espethus, Genarp parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. When she was two years old she was sent to live with her maternal grandparents [Ola Fredricksson]({{ '/landgren/person/hanna-ohlsdotter' | relative_url }}) and [Kjerstina Larsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/hanna-ohlsdotter' | relative_url }}) in Skogledhus in Genarp parish <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>. Two years later, in 1820, she was living once again with her parents in Espehus <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>. She lived with her family in Espehus/Espet 13 until sometime in the mid 1830s <sup>[1G](#1G)</sup>.

By 1837 she has married to [Christen Larsson]({{ '/landgren/person/christen-larsson' | relative_url }}) and the two of them are living in Grentinge No. 3 1/4 in Genarp Parish <sup>([1I](#1I))</sup>. In 1842, their first daughter [Kjerstina Christensdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/kjerstina-christensdotter" | relative_url }}) was born on the 16th of May, 1842.
Kjerstina's birth record is odd. It lists her father as Christen Larsson and her mother as Marna Ohlsdotter, while her witnesses are listed as Pehr Pahlsson and Elna Johnsdotter <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>. However, in the household examination record covering her birth, Pehr and Marna are listed as married while Elna and Christen are listed as Kjerstina's parents <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. I'm unsure if the birth record simply mixed up the mother's and female witness' names or if there was an affair. I am inclined to believe it was a mistake in the birth record and that [Elna Johnsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/elna-johnsdotter' | relative_url }}) is indeed her birth mother.

Two years after Kjerstina was born they moved to Hafslemölla village/farm in 1844. On the 27th of June, 1847, Elna's husband, Christen Larsson, died. A year after, she married Daniel Hansson (b. 12/31/1822) on the 16th of October, 1848 <sup>([1J](#1J))</sup>. They lived in Hafslemölla until 1865 <sup>([1M](#1M))</sup> when they moved to Genarp No. 2 <sup>([1N](#1N))</sup>. She and Daniel Hansson lived in  Genarp No. 2 for the rest of their lives. Daniel died in Genarp No. 2 on the 15th of June, 1905 and four years later, Elna died on the 22nd of June, 1909 at the age of 90 <sup>([2A](#2A))</sup>.
