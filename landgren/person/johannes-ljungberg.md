There are no records of Johannes' life before he arrived in Roslätt, Svedala parish in Malmöhus county beyond what is likely his birth record in Vittskövle parish in Kristianstad county. His parents are likely Hans Ljungberg and Helena Blomsström according to this birth record <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. At some point he made the move all the way down to Svedala where he married an unknown woman <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. It appears Johannes remarried around 1807-1808 after his first wife died in October, 1807 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. He married [Ingar Jonsdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/ingar-jonsdotter" | relative_url }}) and ten years later she gave birth to their son, [Peter Ljungberg]({{ "/landgren/person/peter-ljungberg" | relative_url }}) on the 20th of October, 1817 in Roslätt Gård, Svedala parish in Malmöhus county <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup>. Johannes died on the 29th of June, 1829, at the age of 50 <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>.
