In 1820, she lived in Tejarp No. 1 <sup>([1I](#1I))</sup> before she married [Nils Jonsson]({{ '/landgren/person/nils-jonsson' | relative_url }}) sometime in 1821 and moved to his family's farm in Tejarp No. 5. They had their first son, Pehr that same year <sup>([1J](#1J))</sup>. Two years later, [Ola Nilsson]({{ '/landgren/person/ola-nilsson' | relative_url }}) was born on the 4th of November, 1823 <sup>([1K](#1K))</sup>.
