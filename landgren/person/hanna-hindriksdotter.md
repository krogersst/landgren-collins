Hanna Hindriksdotter was born on March 18, 1798 to Anna Tufvetsdotter (06/15/1757) and Henric Pehrsson (03/10/1759) in Resåkra, Hyby parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. The family lived in Resåkrahus until 1814 <sup>([1B](#1B), [1C](#1C), [1D](#1D))</sup> when they moved to Eksholm No. 3 <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>, most likely a farm in Hyby parish. In 1816, Hanna moved to Eksholm No. 4 <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup> and later that year her father, Henric Pehrsson, died on the 22nd of December, 1816 <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>. By 1818, Hana had moved again to Eksholm No. 1 and 2 <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup> and then to Winnige No. 4 in Hyby parish in 1819 <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>. In 1820, she lived in Tejarp No. 1 <sup>([1I](#1I))</sup> before she married [Nils Jonsson]({{ '/landgren/person/nils-jonsson' | relative_url }}) sometime in 1821 and moved to his family's farm in Tejarp No. 5. They had their first son, Pehr that same year <sup>([1J](#1J))</sup>. Two years later, [Ola Nilsson]({{ '/landgren/person/ola-nilsson' | relative_url }}) was born on the 4th of November, 1823 <sup>([1K](#1K))</sup>. Nils and Hanna lived together on the farm for the rest of their lives <sup>([1L](#1L), [1M](#1M), [1N](#1N), [1O](#1O), [1P](#1P))</sup>.

On the 16th of April, 1850, Nils Jonsson passed away at the age of 56 <sup>([1N](#1N))</sup>. Jons Andersson then became the head of household starting in 1851 <sup>([1O](#1O))</sup>. He lived with Hanna in Tejarp No. 5 until her death on the 27th of April, 1860 <sup>([1P](#1P))</sup>.
