Nils Jonsson was born on the 4th of June, 1794 to Elna Pehrsdotter (b. 01/08/1766) and Jons Nilsson (b. 02/17/1761) in Tejarp, Hyby parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. He lives with his family until the age of 13 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup> when he goes to live for a year in Bomhuset in Hyby parish <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>. He spends his 15th year with his parents in Tejarp No. 12 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup> before striking out again to most likely work as a farm laborer on Tejarp No. 1 farm in 1810 <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup>, Tejarp No. 4 farm in 1811 and 1812 <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>, and Tejarp No. 2 in 1813 <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. He returns home at age 20 to spend a year with his family in Tejarp No. 12 <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup> in 1814. The next year he heads back to Tejarp No. 2 <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>, followed by a year in Winninge No. 12 <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>, and another year in Winninge No. 4 <sup>([1I](#1I))</sup>. In 1818 he's back on Tejarp No. 2 farm <sup>([1J](#1J))</sup> and in 1819 he spends a year on Tejarp No. 8 farm <sup>([1K](#1K))</sup>.

Finally in 1820, at the age of 26 Nils Jonsson settles down in Tejarp No. 5, which seems to previously have been Tejarp No. 12, thus coming full circle. After working elsewhere for many years he has come home to start a family on his parents' farm <sup>([1L](#1L))</sup>. He and [Hanna Hindriksdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/hanna-hindriksdotter' | relative_url }}) are married sometime in 1821 and have their first son, Pehr <sup>([1L](#1L))</sup>. Two years later, [Ola Nilsson]({{ '/landgren/person/ola-nilsson' | relative_url }}) is born on the 4th of November, 1823 <sup>([1M](#1M))</sup>. Nils and Hanna live on his parents' farm for the rest of their lives <sup>([1N](#1N), [1O](#1O), [1P](#1P))</sup>. His father dies on the 23rd of October in 1829 <sup>([1Q](#1Q))</sup> and on the 1st of September, 1836, his mother dies <sup>([1P](#1P))</sup>. On the 16th of April, 1850, Nils Jonsson passes away at the age of 56 <sup>([1P](#1P))</sup>.
