On the 16th of Novemeber, 1836, Nils Andersson was born to [Anna Hansdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/anna-hansdotter" | relative_url }}) and [Anders Danielsson]({{ "/landgren/person/anders-danielsson" | realtive_url }}) in No. 7 Genarp, Genarp parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. The family lived in Genarp No. 7 until 1838 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup> when they moved to Galtesjöhus farm or village in Genarp parish <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>. Nils lived with his family in Galtesjöhus for 13 years <sup>([1C](#1C), [1D](#1D), [1E](#1E))</sup> until he moved away for a year in 1857 to live in Kornheddinge in Kyrkheddinge parish <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. After he moved back home to Galtesjöhus, the family lived there for another nine years <sup>([1G](#1G), [1H](#1H))</sup> before moving to Hafslemölla in 1867, the same year Nils married [Kjerstina Christensdotte]({{ "/landgren/person/kjerstina-christensdotter" | relative_url }}) on the 19th of April.

Two years later, their daughter Anna was born on the 27th of May, 1869 <sup>([4](#4))</sup>.
