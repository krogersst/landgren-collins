Anna Hansdotter was born on the 1st of June, 1800 to [Elna Mansdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/anna-hansdotter" | relative_url }}) and [Hans Olsson]({{ "/landgren/person/anna-hansdotter" | relative_url }}) in Warby, Bara parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. Her father passed away when she was 13 years old and her mother remarried the following year to Jacob Jonsson in 1814 <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>. Three years later, the family moved to No. 5 1/2 Lyngby in Lyngby parish <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup> although it seems that Anna left home shortly after as she doesn't show up in the household examination record for Elna and Jacob <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>.
