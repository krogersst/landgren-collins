Lars Nilsson was born on the 23rd of February, 1853 to [Hanna Nilsdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/hanna-nilsdotter" | relative_url }}) and [Nils Johnsson]({{ "/landgren/person/nils-johnsson" | relative_url }}) in Höör parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1](#1),[3A](#3A))</sup>. He lived in Sjunnerup No. 2 (Sjunnerup Hus/Stenshutt) in Höör parish with his family for the next 18 years <sup>([3B](#3B), [3C](#3C), [3D](#3D), [3E](#3E))</sup>. During that time, his father, Nils Johnsson, died on the 16th of November, 1867. Four years later, Lars moved to No. 4 Togdaröd in Höör parish in 1871 where he lived for a year <sup>([3F](#3F))</sup>. After this, he most likely moved between many places in Höör between 1872 and 1873 as his name is listed under "Personas utan ftadigt mer kåndt hemwist" or list of persons without a steady residence for that time period <sup>([3G](#3G))</sup>.

In December of 1873, he enlisted and moved to Landskrona garnisonsförsamling or the Landskrona garrison parish <sup>([3H](#3H))</sup>. In Landskrona, he was an artilleryman with company No. 80 in the 2nd Battalion <sup>([3I](#3I))</sup>. He was at the Landskrona garrison for two years before moving to Qvesarum, Södra Rörums parish on November 7th, 1875 <sup>([3J](#3J))</sup>. Within four months, he moved again to No. 2 Östra Kattarp, Södra Sallerup on the 16th of February, 1876 <sup>([3K](#3K), [3L](#3L), [3M](#3M))</sup>. One month later he left Södra Sallerup on March 15th, 1876 to live in  Vismarlöf No. 13 in Hyby parish <sup>([3N](#3N), [2A](#2A))</sup>. This move was also short lived as he left for Torup in Bara parish on November 20, 1876 <sup>([2A](#2A), [2B](#2B))</sup>.

Lars lived in Torup, Bara parish until November 6, 1877 where he shows up in the "Efter socknen" or section written after the original recording of the Bara parish examination where he was listed as moving back to Höör parish on the 2nd of August, 1878 <sup>([2C](#2C))</sup>. He does indeed show up in his hometown of No. 2 Sjunnerup from August 23rd, 1878 to November 14, 1879 <sup>([2D](#2D))</sup>. From Sjunnerup he moved to Torupshus in Bara parish where he met and married [Johanna Ljungberg]({{ "/landgren/person/johanna-ljungberg" | relative_url }})<sup>([3O](#3O))</sup>.

Johanna's first daughter, Karna Mathilda, was born out of wedlock about one year before she and Lars married on the 30th of December, 1879 <sup>([3O](#3O), [4](#4))</sup>. It is unlikely that Lars is her first daughter's father as Sjunnerup is about 60km away from Torupshus. Three years after their marriage, they have [Nils Peter Landgren]({{ "/landgren/person/nils-landgren" | relative_url }}) on the 7th of December, 1881 <sup>([3O](#3O), [5](#5))</sup>. Nine years after Nils' birth, Lars left his family on the 12th of November, 1890 at the age of 43 and was reported as a "rymd" or runaway <sup>([2E](#2E), [2F](#2F))</sup>. It is unknown where he ended up after he left the family.  <sup>([2?](#2?), [5](#5))</sup>. In parish record for 1895 to 1907, he is listed as a runaway with his wife's death on June 13th, 1902 recorded in the widower section of the register <sup>([2G](#2G))</sup>.
