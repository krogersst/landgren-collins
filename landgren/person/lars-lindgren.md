Lars Nilsson was born on the 23rd of February, 1853 to [Hanna Nilsdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/hanna-nilsdotter" | relative_url }}) and [Nils Johnsson]({{ "/landgren/person/nils-johnsson" | relative_url }}) in Höör parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1](#1),[3A](#3A))</sup>. He lived in Sjunnerup No. 2 (Sjunnerup Hus/Stenshutt) in Höör parish with his family for the next 18 years <sup>([3B](#3B), [3C](#3C), [3D](#3D), [3E](#3E))</sup>. During that time, his father, Nils Johnsson, died on the 16th of November, 1867. Four years later, Lars moved to No. 4 Togdaröd in Höör parish in 1871 where he lived for a year <sup>([3F](#3F))</sup>. After this, he most likely moved between many places in Höör between 1872 and 1873 as his name is listed under "Personas utan ftadigt mer kåndt hemwist" or list of persons without a steady residence for that time period <sup>([3G](#3G))</sup>.

In December of 1873, he enlisted and moved to Landskrona garnisonsförsamling or the Landskrona garrison parish <sup>([3H](#3H))</sup>. In Landskrona, he was an artilleryman with company No. 80 in the 2nd Battalion <sup>([3I](#3I))</sup>. He was at the Landskrona garrison for two years before moving to Qvesarum, Södra Rörums parish on November 7th, 1875 <sup>([3J](#3J))</sup>. Within four months, he moved again to No. 2 Östra Kattarp, Södra Sallerup on the 16th of February, 1876 <sup>([3K](#3K), [3L](#3L), [3M](#3M))</sup>. One month later he left Södra Sallerup on March 15th, 1876 to live in  Vismarlöf No. 13 in Hyby parish <sup>([3N](#3N), [2A](#2A))</sup>. This move was also short lived as he left for Torup in Bara parish on November 20, 1876 <sup>([2A](#2A), [2B](#2B))</sup>.

Lars' wife has her first daughter, Karna Mathilda, out of wedlock. In the 1867-1874 parish record, Karna Mathilda is listed as Johanna's daughter, born on the 2nd of December, 1878 <sup>([3G](#3G))</sup>. The corresponding birth index entry for Karna only lists Johanna as her mother, no father is listed<sup>([7](#7))</sup>. This happens one year before Johanna's marriage to Lars Nilsson Lindgren, on the 30th of December, 1879 <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. Lars doesn't officially move to Torupshus until November, and he had previously been living in Munkarp, around 60 km away <sup>([3H](#3H))</sup>. Three years after their marriage, they have [Nils Peter Landgren]({{ "/landgren/person/nils-landgren" | relative_url }}).

Lars moves away from the family on the 12th of November, 1890 <sup>([2?](#2?))</sup> wherein he is recorded as a "rymd" or runaway. Two years later, Johanna dies on the 13th of June, 1902 <sup>([2?](#2?), [5](#5))</sup>.

Under the " ???? absent" section of the 1884-1894 parish records, he is recorded as a "husman" as well as a married man. Under additional notes he is also recorded as "Rymd från " or a runaway from. In the next parish record, he is listed as a runaway with his wife's death recorded in the widower section of the register.
