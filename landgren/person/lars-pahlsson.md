Lars Pahlsson was born on March 3, 1777 to Påhl Andersson and an unknown mother in Genarp parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. He shows up in the records again in the early 1810s in Rockarp No. 1, Genarp parish already married to [Karna Jonsdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/karna-jonsdotter" | relative_url }}) (b. 4/10/1783 Klagstorpshus) <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. On the 31 of May, 1815, their son [Christen Larsson]({{ "/landgren/person/christen-larsson" | relative_url }}) was born in Rockarp, Genarp parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>. The family lived in Rockarp 1 1/4 in Genarp parish <sup>([1D](#1D), [1E](#1E))</sup> until 1821 when they moved to Tegelbrukshus A of Nydamshus in Genarp <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. Christen moved away from home in 1825 <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>.

Lars and Karna lived in Tegelbrukshus for the next 30 or so years. During that time, something must have happened as they are listed as "fattighjon" or "pauper" in the 1844-1852 household record <sup>([1J](#1J))</sup>. In the next record, Lars moves to an unknown place on the 25th of October, 1855 <sup>([1K](#1K))</sup>. His wife stays in Tegelbrukshus and dies three years later on the 2nd of July, 1859, still listed as a fattighjon <sup>([1L](#1L))</sup>.
