Ingar Jonsdotter was born in Sönnarps Gård, Skabersjö parish, Malmöhus county on the 23rd of October, 1788 to Jons Olsson and a mother with a last name Boelsdotter <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. It is difficult to parse the household examination records during the time she would have been in Skabersjö but she does show up in Roslätt, Svedala parish in 1807 where she married [Johannes Ljungberg]({{ "/landgren/person/johannes-ljungberg" | relative_url }}) around 1807-1808 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. Ten years later she gave birth to their son, [Peter Ljungberg]({{ "/landgren/person/peter-ljungberg" | relative_url }}) on the 20th of October, 1817 in Roslätt Gård, Svedala parish in Malmöhus county <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup>. Her first husband, Johannes died on the 29th of June, 1829, at the age of 50 <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>. Two years later she moved to Svedala No. 18 3/4 and married Lars Olsson <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>. Lars was listed as a Torparen, a type of farmer in the 1832-1838 household examination record <sup>([1I](#1I))</sup>. By 1838-1844 he was still listed as a torpare with the word utfattige or desitute written above his name <sup>([1J](#1J))</sup>. In the following two household examination records, Lars was recorded as both "utfattige och bräcklig" or [destitue and fragile, often referring to weak health (in old age)](http://sites.rootsweb.com/~swewgw/Fact/Dict/facdic02.htm) <sup>([1K](#1K), [1L](#1L))</sup>. The two lived in Svedala No. 18 3/4 for 30 years until the two had to relocate to the Svedala poor house in 1861 where Lars' died on the 25th of June, 1862 <sup>([1N](#1N), [1O](#1O))</sup>. Ingar continued living there for another two years before her own death at the age of 75 on March 2, 1863 <sup>([1O](#1O))</sup>.
