Ten years later she gave birth to their son, [Peter Ljungberg]({{ "/landgren/person/peter-ljungberg" | relative_url }}) on the 20th of October, 1817 in Roslätt Gård, Svedala parish in Malmöhus county <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup>. Her first husband, Johannes died on the 29th of June, 1829, at the age of 50 <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup>. Two years later she moved to Svedala No. 18 3/4 and married Lars Olsson <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>. The two lived in Svedala No. 18 3/4 for 30 years until the two had to relocate to the Svedala poor house in 1861 where Lars' died on the 25th of June, 1862 <sup>([1N](#1N), [1O](#1O))</sup>.
