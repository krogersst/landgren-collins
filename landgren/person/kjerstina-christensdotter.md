Anna was born on the 27th of May, 1869 to [Nils Andersson]({{ '/landgren/person/anna-nilsdotter' | relative_url }}) and [Kjerstina Christensdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/kjerstina-christensdotter' | relative_url }}) <sup>([1](#1))</sup>. She lived with her parents in Hafslemölla (Grentige No. 8), Genarp, Malmöhus <sup>([5A](#5A), [5B](#5B), [5C](#5C))</sup> until on the 10th of October, 1884, she moved away from home to Lönnekullen, Genarp, Malmöhus <sup>([5D](#5D))</sup>. A little less than a year later she moved to Genarp No. 6 on the 17th of September, 1885 <sup>([5D](#5D), [2A](#2A))</sup>. She then moved again a year later to Genarp No 7. on the 23rd of September, 1886 <sup>([2A](#2A), [2B](#2B))</sup>. She then left for Bara No. 12, Bara, Malmöhus on the 25th of October, 1887 <sup>([2B](#2B))</sup> and arrived there on the 2nd of November, 1887 <sup>([2C](#2C))</sup>. She married [Jöns Olof Sandqvist]({{ '/landgren/person/jons-sandqvist' | relative_url }}) on the 30th of March, 1889 and moved with him to Qvarnby #7, Södra Sallerup, Malmöhus <sup>([2D](#2D), [3](#3))</sup>. Nine months later, their first daughter, [Emma Sandqvist]({{ '/landgren/person/emma-sandqvist' | relative_url }}) was born on December 31st, 1889 <sup>([2D](#2D))</sup>. The family lived in Qvarnby #7 from 1889 to 1895 <sup>([2D](#2D))</sup> before they moved to Tullstorp #4. Emma lived with her family in Tullstorp until 1906 when she married [Nils Peter Landgren]({{ '/landgren/person/nils-landgren' | relative_url }}) <sup>([2E](#2E))</sup>. Here the records available online drop off until Anna's death on the 24th of December, 1938. She and Jöns seem to have stayed in the same place since 1895, passing away in No. 4 Tullstorp, Södra Sallerup, Malmöhus. Her cause of death is likely cardiosclerosis <sup>([4](#4))</sup>.
