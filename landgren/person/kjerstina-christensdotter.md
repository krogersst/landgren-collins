Kjerstina's birth record is weird because it lists her father as Christen Larsson and her mother as Marna Ohlsdotter, while her witnesses are listed as Pehr Pahlsson and Elna Johnsdotters. However, in the household examination record for that time period, Pehr and Marna are listed as married while Elna and Christen are listed as Kjerstina's parents. I'm unsure if the birth record simply mixed up the mother's and female witness' names or if there was an affair.

On the 27th of June, 1847, her father Christen Larsson dies. A year after, her mother marries Daniel Hamsson on the 16th of October, 1848.

Kyrkheddinge county, Malmöhus

Anna was born on the 27th of May, 1869 to [Nils Andersson]({{ '/landgren/person/anna-nilsdotter' | relative_url }}) and [Kjerstina Christensdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/kjerstina-christensdotter' | relative_url }}) <sup>([1](#1))</sup>. She lived with her parents in Hafslemölla (Grentige No. 8), Genarp, Malmöhus <sup>([5A](#5A), [5B](#5B), [5C](#5C))</sup> until on the 10th of October, 1884, she moved away from home to Lönnekullen, Genarp, Malmöhus <sup>([5D](#5D))</sup>.

Kjerstina died on the 23rd of August, 1920.
