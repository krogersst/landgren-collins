Kjerstina's birth record is odd. It lists her father as Christen Larsson and her mother as Marna Ohlsdotter, while her witnesses are listed as Pehr Pahlsson and Elna Johnsdotter <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. However, in the household examination record covering her birth, Pehr and Marna are listed as married while Elna and Christen are listed as Kjerstina's parents <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. I'm unsure if the birth record simply mixed up the mother's and female witness' names or if there was an affair. I am inclined to believe it was a mistake in the birth record and that [Christen Larsson]({{ '/landgren/person/christen-larsson' | relative_url }}) and [Elna Johnsdotter]({{ '/landgren/person/elna-johnsdotter' | relative_url }}) are her birth parents.

The family lived in Grentinge No. 3 1/4 village or farm in Genarp parish, Malmöhus county during the time of Kjerstina's birth. Two years after she was born they moved to Hafslemölla village/farm in 1844 <sup>([1B](#1B))</sup>. On the 27th of June, 1847, Kjerstina's father, Christen Larsson, died. A year after, her mother married Daniel Hansson on the 16th of October, 1848 <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>. Kjerstina moved away from her family's home in Hafslemölla in 1857 <sup>([1D](#1D), [1G](#1G))</sup>, ending up in Toppeladugård, Genarp for a year <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>, then in L. Glamberg, Genarp for another year <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. After being away from home from 1857 to 1859, she returned to Hafslemölla for three years <sup>([1G](#1G), [1H](#1H))</sup>. In 1865 she moved once again to Kyrkheddinge parish, Malmöhus before returning home in 1867 and marrying [Nils Andersson]({{ '/landgren/person/anna-nilsdotter' | relative_url }})<sup>([1H](#1H), [3](#3))</sup>.

Two years later, their daughter Anna was born on the 27th of May, 1869 <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. Anna lived with her parents in Hafslemölla (Grentige No. 8), Genarp, Malmöhus until the 10th of October, 1884, when she moved away from home <sup>([1I](#1I), [1J](#1J), [1K](#1K))</sup>. Kjerstina and Nils continued to live in Hafslemölla (Grentige No. 8), Genarp, at least through 1916 where the online records drop off <sup>([2A](#2A))</sup>. On the 23rd of August, 1920, Kjerstina died in Genarp parish at the age of 78 <sup>([5](#5))</sup>.
