On this same page as Nils is listed, Emma's family and her previous entry as Jons Sandqvist's and Anna Nilsdotter's daughter can be seen. Nils is recorded as having arrived in Tullstorp #4, Södra Sallerup on the 12th of April and less than a month later he marries Emma Sandqvist on the 1st of May, 1907, as recorded in the Tullstorp #4 household examination record <sup>([2E](#2E))</sup> and their marriage record <sup>([3](#3))</sup>. The same day as their marriage they are recorded as leaving Södra Sallerup and moving to Limhamn village/farm in the parish of Hyllie <sup>([2E](#2E))</sup>.

They arrive in Limhamn seven days after their wedding. Five months later their first child, Anna Paulina Landgren, is born in Limhamn on the 9th of October, 1907 <sup>([2F](#2F))</sup>. This, combined with Nils' abrupt appearance in Tullstorp and subsequent marriage, suggests that they married because of Emma's pregnancy. Tullstorp, Södra Sallerup and Sunnanå, Burlöv are not very far apart from each other at all, so their meeting is fairly likely. In contrast to these areas, Limhamn, Hyllie, is much closer to the city center, a likely spot for newly weds to try to make a life.

They moved back to Södra Sallerup #4 on the 8th of February 1910, a little less than a year later on the 14th of January 1911, their son Knut Toge Arnold Landgren was born <sup>([2H](#2H))</sup>. In 1911 they moved to Tullstorp #5, Södra Sallerup <sup>([2I](#2I))</sup>. This record mentions that they move away from Tullstorp #5 but no date is recorded indicating when they moved. It does mention that the corresponding record is in the next household examination book on page 281. However, this book is not yet available.

There is currently a gap between the household examination records and their immigration records of about three years. However, it is unlikely they traveled outside of the Södra Sallerup parish during this time as it is their last permanent residence as recorded on his emigration record <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. They left on the ship Öresundsångare on the 27th of January, 1914 from the port at the city of Malmö and traveled to Liverpool, England <sup>([5](#5))</sup> where the boarded the Lusitania, arriving in New York on the 6th of February 1914 <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. Their final desitination is listed as Winnebago County, Illinois on both the Swedish Emigration record <sup>([5](#5))</sup> and the New York Passenger List <sup>([4](#4))</sup>.

The following year in 1915 they are living in Rockford, when Erick Landgren is born. A year later Mary L. Landgren is born. By 1919, Nils and Emma have made a home at 1339 6th Av. in Rockford, Illinois and Nils is working as a "hammer helper" at RDF Co. at this time <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. In the 1920 Census <sup>([7](#7))</sup> he is listed as a blacksmith working in the machine shop industry. The family is also recorded as living with three other Swedish immigrants: Axle Josephson, Otto Carlson, and William Hugo Matthison. A year later, on the 12th of April 1921 he becomes a natuarlized citizen

By 1929 he is no longer living with Emma Landgren according to the listing in the Rockford Directories <sup>([12](#12))</sup>.
