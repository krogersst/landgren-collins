Emma Sandqvist was born in Qvarnby #7, Södra Sallerup, Malmöhus on December 31st, 1889 <sup>([1](#1))</sup>. The family lived in Qvarnby #7 from 1889 to 1895 <sup>([2A](#2A))</sup> before they moved to Tullstorp #4 <sup>([2B](#2B))</sup>. Emma lived with her family in Tullstorp until 1906 <sup>([2B](#2B), [2C](#2C), [2D](#2D))</sup> when she married [Nils Peter Landgren]({{ "/landgren/person/nils-landgren" | relative_url }}) less than a month after he had arrived in Tullstorp on the 12th of April <sup>([2D](#2D), [3](#3))</sup>. The same day as their marriage they are recorded as leaving Södra Sallerup and moving to Limhamn village/farm in the parish of Hyllie <sup>([2D](#2D))</sup>.

They arrive in Limhamn seven days after their wedding. Five months later their first child, Anna Paulina Landgren, is born in Limhamn on the 9th of October, 1907 <sup>([2E](#2E))</sup>. This, combined with Nils' abrupt appearance in Tullstorp and subsequent marriage, suggests that they married because of Emma's pregnancy. Tullstorp, Södra Sallerup and Sunnanå, Burlöv are not very far apart from each other at all, so their meeting is fairly likely. In contrast to these areas, Limhamn, Hyllie, is much closer to the city center, a likely spot for newly weds to try to make a life.

They moved back to Södra Sallerup #4 on the 8th of February 1910 <sup>([2F](#2F))</sup>, a little less than a year later on the 14th of January 1911, their son Knut Toge Arnold Landgren was born <sup>([2G](#2G))</sup>. In 1911 they moved to Tullstorp #5, Södra Sallerup <sup>([2G](#2G))</sup>. This record mentions that they move away from Tullstorp #5 but no date is recorded indicating when they moved. It does mention that the corresponding record is in the next household examination book on page 281. However, this book is not yet available.

There is currently a gap between the household examination records and their immigration records of about three years. However, it is unlikely they traveled outside of the Södra Sallerup parish during this time as it is their last permanent residence as recorded on her emigration record <sup>([5](#5))</sup>. They left on the ship Öresundsångare on the 27th of January, 1914 from the port at the city of Malmö and traveled to Liverpool, England <sup>([5](#5))</sup> where they boarded the Lusitania, arriving in New York on the 6th of February 1914 <sup>([4](#4))</sup>. Their final desitination is listed as Winnebago County, Illinois on both the Swedish Emigration record <sup>([5](#5))</sup> and the New York Passenger List <sup>([4](#4))</sup>.

The following year in 1915 they are living in Rockford, when Erick Landgren is born. A year later Mary L. Landgren is born. By 1919, Nils and Emma have made a home at 1339 6th Av. in Rockford, Illinois and Emma is working at Clara's Cafe <sup>([7](#7))</sup>. In the 1920 Census <sup>([6](#6))</sup> she is listed as a laborer at a boarding house. The family is also recorded as living with three other Swedish immigrants: Axle Josephson, Otto Carlson, and William Hugo Matthison, so perhaps her occupation is in reference to this.

By 1929 Nils is no longer living with Emma according to the listing in the Rockford Directories <sup>([7](#7))</sup>, and she lives in the same place until around 1941. She lives at 2706 10th St. for three years, stays for a brief stint in 2710 10th St. in 1945 before moving to 1807 7th St. before living at her last recorded residence at 1111 7th St. She works at several restaurants over the years according to the directories, such as Skandia Cafe in 1929, West Cafe in 1937, Kling's Swedish Village in 1942, and finally she is listed as a cook at Rick's Bowling Lanes Luncheonette from 1944 until her death on August 16th, 1949 <sup>([8](#8), [10](#10), [11](#11))</sup>.

She is buried in the Scandinavian Cemetery in Rockford, Winnebago County, Illinois, USA.
