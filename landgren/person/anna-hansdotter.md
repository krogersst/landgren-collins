Anna Hansdotter was born on the 1st of June, 1800 to [Elna Mansdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/anna-hansdotter" | relative_url }}) and [Hans Olsson]({{ "/landgren/person/anna-hansdotter" | relative_url }}) in Warby, Bara parish, Malmöhus county <sup>([1A](#1A))</sup>. Her father passed away when she was 13 years old and her mother remarried the following year to Jacob Jonsson in 1814 <sup>([1C](#1C))</sup>. Three years later, the family moved to No. 5 1/2 Lyngby in Lyngby parish <sup>([1D](#1D))</sup> although it seems that Anna left home shortly after as she doesn't show up in the household examination record for Elna and Jacob <sup>([1E](#1E))</sup>. I cannot find records for the period between 1817 and 1820. When she shows up again in Winninge Torp, Hyby parish, she is recorded as having moved from Brågarp parish in 1820 <sup>([1F](#1F))</sup>. In 1822 she moved back to her family's village/farm of No. 5 Lyngby <sup>([1G](#1G))</sup> before moving to Grentinge No. 3 in Genarp parish two years later <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup>.

In Genarp parish, she met [Anders Danielsson]({{ "/landgren/person/anders-danielsson" | relative_url }}). They married in 1826 <sup>([1H](#1H))</sup> and moved to Anders' 'hometown' of No. 6 Lyngby <sup>([1I](#1I))</sup>. Three years later they move briefly to No. 5 Lyngby <sup>([1J](#1J))</sup> before settling down in Genarp No. 7 in Genarp parish for the next eight years <sup>([1K](#1K), [1M](#1M))</sup>. During their time in Genarp No. 7, on the 16th of Novemeber, 1836, [Nils Andersson]({{ "/landgren/person/nils-andersson" | relative_url }}) was born <sup>([1L](#1L))</sup>.

In 1838 the family moved to Galtesjöhus in Genarp parish <sup>([1N](#1N))</sup>. Anna and Anders lived there for 29 years before they moved to Hafslemölla in 1867 <sup>([1S](#1S))</sup>, the same year Nils married [Kjerstina Christensdotter]({{ "/landgren/person/kjerstina-christensdotter" | relative_url }}) <sup>([1R](#1R))</sup>. A year after Nils' marriage, Anna Hansdotter died on the 20th of February, 1868 <sup>([1T](#1T))</sup>.
