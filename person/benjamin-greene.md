The only evidence of Benjamin's existence I have found so far is from _Descendants of Joseph Greene of Westerly, R.I._. I am still looking for corroborating records although it appears there is a will somewhere. As his parentage is disputed even within this book, listing John and Joan Greene as part of the lineage is so far, ill advised.

From _Descendants of Joseph Greene of Westerly, R.I._,
   > "His name appears in the freeman's list of North Kingstown in 1696. In 1698-1703 he was deputy to the General Assembly; 1701-1704 member of the Town Council; 1702 ratemaker; 1703, appointed to lay out highways. March 26, 1705, he sold land in Kingstown and soon removed to East Greenwich . . ." <sup>[1](#1)</sup>
