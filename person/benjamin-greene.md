The only evidence of Benjamin's existence I have found so far is in compilations of lineages. I am still looking for corroborating records, as there seems to be a few as his public service is well documented. The main record I would like to get access to is the will that gives evidence of his wife's identity and his children. At least this has been trasncribed in part <sup>[2](#2)</sup>. Until such records are digitized or I can travel to see physical copies, I will have to make do with this.

From _The Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island_,
  > "Exs. wife Humility and Captain Benjamin Nichols, of Kings Town, and if latter die, then Joshua Coggeshall to succeed him. To wife, all household goods and moveables. To son John, farm he lives on." <sup>[2](#2)</sup>

As his parentage is disputed in _Descendants of Joseph Greene of Westerly, R.I_, I have been hesitant in listing John and Joan Greene as part of this lineage so far. However, _The Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island_ seems rather unambigous about Benjamin's lineage, giving me some hope in the connection being possible.

From _Descendants of Joseph Greene of Westerly, R.I._,
   > "His name appears in the freeman's list of North Kingstown in 1696. In 1698-1703 he was deputy to the General Assembly; 1701-1704 member of the Town Council; 1702 ratemaker; 1703, appointed to lay out highways. March 26, 1705, he sold land in Kingstown and soon removed to East Greenwich . . ." <sup>[1](#1)</sup>
   
_The Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island_ <sup>[2](#2)</sup> also cites the will, with a much more firm
